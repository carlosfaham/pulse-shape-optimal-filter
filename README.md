Optimal Filter for matching a template to noisy data

See Sunil Golwala's Berkeley PhD thesis for more information about Optimal Filters:
http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/preprints/cdms/golwalathesis/thesis_app.pdf

OptimalFilter.m will perform the optimal filter match from an idealized template to noisy time-series data. 
It outputs the best time-delay and amplitude estimators for the template matching.
